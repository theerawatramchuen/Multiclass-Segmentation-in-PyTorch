## Introduction

Multiclass segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, particularly in scenarios like precision agriculture where accurately identifying and segmenting multiple classes of weeds can improve crop yield and reduce herbicide usage. This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the U-Net architecture tailored for multiclass segmentation tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Multiclass Weeds Dataset for Image Segmentation](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Multiclass_Weeds_Dataset_for_Image_Segmentation/22643434?file=40195219), hosted on FigShare. This dataset includes annotated images of agricultural fields with multiple classes of weeds, facilitating supervised learning for segmentation tasks.
